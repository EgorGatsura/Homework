1. Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c.The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case. (In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).
2. Based on the score in a 10-point rating system, output the equivalent in a 5-point rating system - "was absent"; "not satisfactorily", "satisfactorily", "good", "excellent".
3. Depending on the entered value (1..12) corresponding to the month of the year, output the corresponding season.
